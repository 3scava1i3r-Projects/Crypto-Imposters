# Crypto-Imposters


## Problem Statements

- Our goal is to figure out how we can use Defi+NFT space in various fields, such as trading and gaming.
- Another problem we're looking to solve is - how can we give some real value to our impostor nft with the help of sticky nfts
- Finding new possibilities in the NFT space for gameFi
- Provide Fixed Interest rates on some assets using Defi

## Description

Making Composable NFTs for gamefi based Impostor game - By our MVP we wish to start a generative art project that is targetted towards making not only NFTs but defi based NFT avatars which will have some detachable traits which means every component of the nft has its own value that can be sold/bought.The detachable traits will themselves be a new form of sticky nfts, therefore we can have some defi + nft work done in this space as well.We would then create a marketplace for the Impostors and the detachable traits. The starting NFT will be an 88mph based Fixed Interest Rate Bond NFT and the sticky NFTs would be an extension so we thought of adding yield farming system supported by our sticky nfts through the provision of new lp sticky nfts of ImposterSwap made by Us.Also We would have our very own Token for the facilitation of the overall protocol

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
