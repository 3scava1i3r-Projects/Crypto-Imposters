# Crypto-Imposters


## Problem Statements

- Our goal is to figure out how we can use Defi+NFT space in various fields, such as trading and gaming.
- Another problem we're looking to solve is how we can give some real value to our impostor nft with the help of sticky nfts
- Finding new possibilities in the NFT space for gameFi(somewhat like a revamp of aavegotchi)
- Provide Fixed Interest rates on some assets using Defi
- Provide ability to make liquidity provider sticky NFTs,maybe research on yield farming on top of the Imposter NFT

## Description

Making Composable NFTs for gamefi based Impostor game - By our MVP we wish to start a generative art project that is targetted towards making not only NFTs but defi based NFT avatars which will have some detachable traits which means every component of the nft has its own value that can be sold/bought.The detachable traits will themselves be a new form of sticky nfts, therefore we can have some defi + nft work done in this space as well.We would then create a marketplace for the Impostors and the detachable traits. The starting NFT will be an 88mph based Fixed Interest Rate Bond NFT and the sticky NFTs are the detachable traits ,so we thought of adding yield farming system supported by our sticky nfts through the provision of new lp sticky nfts of ImposterSwap made by Us.Also We would have our very own Token for the facilitation of the overall protocol, for buying and selling traits and potions, maybe have yield farming to work on top of this later
